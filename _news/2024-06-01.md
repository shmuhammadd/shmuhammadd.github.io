I am pleased to share that I am co-organizing a SemEval-2025 shared on [Bridging the Gap in Text-Based Emotion Detection"](https://github.com/emotion-analysis-project/SemEval2025-Task11/tree/main)

Emotions are simultaneously familiar and mysterious. On the one hand, we all express and manage our emotions every day. Yet, on the other hand, emotions are complex, nuanced, and sometimes hard to articulate.

We use language in subtle and complex ways to express emotion (Wiebe et al. 2005, Mohammad and Kiritcheko 2018, Mohammad et al. 2018). Further, people are highly variable in how they perceive and express emotions (even within the same culture or social group). Thus, we can never truly identify how one is feeling based on something that they have said with absolute certainty.

Emotion recognition is not one task but an umbrella term for several tasks such as detecting the emotions of the speaker, identifying what emotion a piece of text is conveying and detecting emotions evoked in a reader.

This task is on perceived emotions and focuses on: Determining what emotion most people will think the speaker may be feeling given a sentence or a short text snippet uttered by the speaker.
