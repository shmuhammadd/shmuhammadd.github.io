I will be traveling to Cameroon to teach a course on **Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)** at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS).

I’m looking forward to engaging with the students and contributing to ongoing efforts in strengthening NLP education across the continent.
