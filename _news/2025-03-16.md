I will be traveling to Cameroon to teach a short course on **Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)** at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS).

The course will introduce core NLP concepts, including text preprocessing, embeddings, language modeling, and multilingual applications, with examples drawn from African languages. I’m looking forward to engaging with the students and contributing to ongoing efforts in strengthening NLP education across the continent.
