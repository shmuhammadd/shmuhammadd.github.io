I am an Advanced Research Fellow and a Google DeepMind Academic Fellow at Imperial College London. I received my PhD from the University of Porto, Portugal, under the supervision of Professor Pavel Brazdil and Professor Alipio Jorge. Prior to that, I earned an MS in Computer Science from the University of Manchester, UK, and a BSc in Computer Science from Bayero University, Kano, Nigeria. I also serve as a faculty member at the Faculty of Computing, Bayero University, Kano-Nigeria.

I am deeply passionate about diversity and inclusion. To further this cause, I co-founded the HausaNLP research group, which aims to advance research and development in Hausa language, one of the most widely spoken languages in Africa. I also founded the Arewa Data Science Academy, which aims to democratize data science and AI education by providing free data science and machine learning training to underserved students in Nigeria.
