I teach courses at **Imperial College London**, **Bayero University Kano (BUK)**, and the **African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS)**. My teaching focuses on applied machine learning, natural language processing, and AI for Social Good, with an emphasis on low-resource, and culturally grounded applications.

## Video Courses & Lectures (YouTube)

I teach in a community book-based learning series (“Book Club”), where I guide participants through topics in machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing using structured readings, discussions, and practical exercises. Below are links to some recorded video lectures from past sessions.

## Supervision

I supervise and mentor students at all levels, from undergraduate projects to PhD dissertations. My supervision focuses on **NLP for low-resource languages**, **responsible AI**, and **cross-cultural language technologies**.

I contribute to strengthening research capacity across Africa through [Arewa Data Science Academy](https://arewadatascience.github.io/) and [HausaNLP](https://hausanlp.github.io/), which I co-founded, where I mentor early-career researchers and nurture collaborative research communities. I am also an active member and mentor in the [MasakhaneNLP](https://www.masakhane.io/) community.

**Current Supervision:**
- 4 PhD Students
- 2 MSc Students  
- 40+ Research Interns
