## Supervision

I supervise and mentor students at all levels, from undergraduate projects to PhD dissertations. My supervision focuses on **NLP for low-resource languages**, **responsible AI**, and **cross-cultural language technologies**.

I contribute to strengthening research capacity across Africa through [Arewa Data Science Academy](https://arewadatascience.github.io/) and [HausaNLP](https://hausanlp.github.io/), which I co-founded, where I mentor early-career researchers and nurture collaborative research communities. I am also an active member and mentor in the [MasakhaneNLP](https://www.masakhane.io/) community.

**Current Supervision:**
- 4 PhD Students
- 2 MSc Students  
- 40+ Research Interns
