I am an Advanced Research Fellow and a Google DeepMind Academic Fellow at Imperial College London. I received my PhD from the University of Porto, Portugal, under the supervision of Professor Pavel Brazdil and Professor Alipio Jorge. Prior to that, I earned an MS in Computer Science from the University of Manchester, UK, and a BSc in Computer Science from Bayero University, Kano, Nigeria. I also serve as a faculty member at the Faculty of Computing, Bayero University, Kano-Nigeria.

I have authored over 60 research papers published in top venues such as ICLR, NeurIPS, ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, and LREC. My work has received wide recognition, contributing to a significant number of citations [![Google Scholar Citations](https://img.shields.io/badge/📚_citations-3290-blue)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ne1nt4gAAAAJ) and 6 best paper awards. I have served the research community in various leadership roles, including Area Chair for ACL, NAACL, and EMNLP.


I am deeply passionate about diversity and inclusion. To further this cause, I co-founded the HausaNLP research group, which aims to advance research and development in Hausa language, one of the most widely spoken languages in Africa. I also founded the Arewa Data Science Academy, which aims to democratize data science and AI education by providing free data science and machine learning training to underserved students in Nigeria.ß
