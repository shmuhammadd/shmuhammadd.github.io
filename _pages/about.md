I am a Google DeepMind Academic Fellow and an Advanced Research Fellow at Imperial College London. I received my PhD from the University of Porto, Portugal, under the supervision of Professor Pavel Brazdil and Professor Alipio Jorge. Prior to that, I earned an MS in Computer Science from the University of Manchester, UK, and a BSc in Computer Science from Bayero University, Kano, Nigeria. I also serve as a faculty member at the Faculty of Computing, Bayero University, Kano, Nigeria, and as a Visiting Lecturer at the African Institute of Mathematical Sciences in Cameroon and South Africa, as well as at York St John University.

My research focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource African languages and aims to bridge the gap in the need for equitable language technologies in underserved communities. I have published in top venues such as ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, ICLR, and NeurIPS. My work has received wide recognition and several best paper awards. I have served the research community in various leadership roles, including as Area Chair for ACL, NAACL, and EMNLP.

I am deeply passionate about diversity and inclusion. To further this cause, I co-founded the [HausaNLP](https://hausanlp.github.io/) research group, which aims to advance research and development in the Hausa language, one of the most widely spoken languages in Africa. I also founded the [Arewa Data Science Academy](https://arewadatascience.github.io/), which seeks to democratize data science and AI education by providing free data science and machine learning training to underserved students.

If you have any questions regarding my research or want to collaborate feel free to contact me anytime.
